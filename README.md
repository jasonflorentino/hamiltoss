_Find out if something is recyclable in Hamilton_

<img src="demo/screenshot.png" alt="A screen shot of Hamiltoss site" width="800" />

This is a site that I made because I found it difficult to look up how to sort my garbage and recycling in Hamilton. And I wanted to learn Svelte and SvelteKit. Special thanks to Will for the name.

Thanks for stopping by!

## Tech intro

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) app made with their TypeScript starter. Styling is done with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and was added to the project using this handy repo [svelte-add/tailwindcss](https://github.com/svelte-add/tailwindcss). Code is formatted with Prettier. I'm using the Prettier plugin `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` to automatically sort tailwind classes in code.

## Setup

You'll need at least `node 18`.

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

The app will be running at

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

## Developing

Once running, you can edit files, save them, and it'll update in the browser.
Make new commits on a feature branch. Branches on this remote will be built on netlify.

You can run `npm run build` locally to check if the build and deloy will succeed. You can then preview the production build with `npm run preview`. Or just push and see.

## Deployment

Once updates are ready, pulling into `main` will get built and deployed to: https://hamiltoss.fyi/

- Added `adapter-netlify` for this.
