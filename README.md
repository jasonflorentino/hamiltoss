## Tech intro

This is a SvelteKit app made with their TypeScript starter:

[Svelte Kit Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction)

[Svelte Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)

Styling is done with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and was added to the project using this handy [svelte-add/tailwindcss](https://github.com/svelte-add/tailwindcss)

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

From there you can edit files, save them, and it'll update in the browser.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deployment

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
